# Policy-Iteration
Using policy iteration and iterative policy evaluation to solve the optimal fast charging problem for a lithium-ion battery.

I include policy iteration files for deterministic systems and for probabilistic Markov chain models.  These files are inspired by material from the course ME597.001: Optimal Control of Energy Systems at Penn State.
