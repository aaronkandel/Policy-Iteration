# Policy-Iteration
Policy iteration and iterative policy evaluation code for a general class of discrete dynamical systems.  I also include a case study in optimal safe fast charging for a lithium-ion battery.

I include policy iteration files for deterministic systems and for probabilistic Markov chain models.  These files are inspired by material from the course ME597.001: Optimal Control of Energy Systems at Penn State. The inputs for my functions are the state transition matrices and transition costs.
